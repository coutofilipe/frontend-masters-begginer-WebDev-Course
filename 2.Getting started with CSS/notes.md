# Getting strated with CSS Project Notes

## Things to add to project:
    . Some colors that you like. Use the colors provided, or go to a site like Adobe Color and choose a color palette for your work.
    . Two fonts that go together. Use ours, or choose two from Google Fonts. If you need help choosing fonts, try FontPair.
    . A photo of yourself;
    . Three examples of your work. Include one screenshot, the work's title, a paragraph description of the work, and any technologies you want to highlight that were used in making your work.
    . Social media links. LinkedIn and Github are recommended, but you may have others you want to include.
    . If you wish, a copy of your resume.
